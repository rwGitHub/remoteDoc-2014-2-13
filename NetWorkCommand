Using tcpdump to sniff HTTP traffic from a specific host
This is mostly just a reminder to myself about my preferred parameters to tcpdump on linux, so that I don't have to keep reading the man page.

tcpdump -c 20 -s 0 -i eth1 -A host 192.168.1.1 and tcp port http

The parameter breakdown:
-c 20: Exit after capturing 20 packets.
-s 0: Don't limit the amount of payload data that is printed out. Print it all.
-i eth1: Capture packets on interface eth1
-A: Print packets in ASCII.
host 192.168.1.1: Only capture packets coming to or from 192.168.1.1.
and tcp port http: Only capture HTTP packets.
